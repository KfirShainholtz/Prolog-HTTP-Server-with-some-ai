# Prolog HTTP Server (and a little AI checkers game)
I haven't found any when I *needed* it badly, so here's a little implementation of a Prolog HTTP server (with the game Checkers using AI implemented by minimax alogirthm)

Not proud at any chunk of this code, and the actual game is too messy, but figured that someone would need to use it in his finals project, or for some weird reason when writing a Prolog server (why would u).

PLEASE DON'T USE THE MINIMAX CODE, OR AT LEAST TRY TO FIX IT.
I haven't implemented it well, and it's messed up somewhere. if someone ever stumbles into this repository and actually fixes it, I'll happily remove this remark.
